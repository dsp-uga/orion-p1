# Project 1: Large Scale Document Classification

The current project aims to classify documents from Reuters New Corpus using a Naive Bayes Algorithm with Laplace smoothing (adding 1 to word count by default). Our goal will be to not only implement this algorithm but do so in a scalable manner while also trying to exceed the benchmark accuracy of 90%
